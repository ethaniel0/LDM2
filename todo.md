Structures
- add checks to make sure no two structures have the same structure
- add checks to make sure no two operator-creating structures with the same trigger have the 
same operator type (binary, unary-l/r, internal) (right now it'll just take the first one)

- allow a structure to create multiple variables or types
- for typename_attributes, specify all
